# Glass_classification-project
Ten attributes from the following dataset are used to describe various types of glasses. The refractive index (RI) and the percentage composition of the following elements are two of the nine that are numerical. Magnesium (Mg), Aluminum (Al), Silicon (Si), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Barium (Ba), and Iron are the other elements in the periodic table (Fe). The final characteristic is categorical and identifies the type of glass, where we can find headlamps, containers, dinnerware, and windows in buildings and cars. The objective is to identify the type of glass and, from a chemical standpoint, comprehend the relationships between the category and numerical parameters. Additionally, the initial study was inspired by a criminological inquiry. If the glass left at the site of the crime can be accurately identified, it can be used as evidence!
